<p> What data is sensitive? </p>
<p>Any information that is relatable to an identified or natural person.  This includes credit card information, home address and phone numbers.</p>
<p>How will you protect it?</p>
<p>By making sure that the sourcecode is only visible to the web developers.  Doing this would involve having administrative priveledges.</p>
<p>What specific technologies will you use for protection?</p>
<p>I will use HTTPS.  This will secure communication over a computer network.</p>
